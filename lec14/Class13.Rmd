##Lecture 14 - RNA-seq

Installing key packages needed for RNA-seq analysis
```{r}
#install.packages("BiocManager")

#For this class, need DESeq2 as well; BiocManager to ensure the package gets pulled from the BiocManager

#BiocManager::install("DESeq2")
```

**Hands-on** notes
*Gene of interest: CRISPLD2 - codes for secreted protein used in lung development

  +Mutation (SNPS) - corticosteroid resistance and bronchodilator response in asthma patients
  +Data analyzed with Tophat and Cufflinks
  +CRISPLD2 mRNA expression examined with qPCR
  
  
Importing countData and colData
```{r}
#reading in data files
counts<- read.csv("airway_scaledcounts.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
```
