\#\#Lecture 11 - 11/5/19 “Structural Bioinformatics” **MOTIVATION**
\*Motivation 1 for Structural Bioinfo.: +Detailed understanding of
molecular interactions

\*Motivation 2: Lot’s of structural data +Need more computer assistance
to analyze large quantities of data +Bottleneck of structural
determination is bioinformatics being limited

\*Motivation 3: Theotrectical and computational predictions

\*Sequence -\> structure -\> function +structure more conserved than
sequence -Recall beta-globin structures conserved in different species
+structure is encoded in sequence

**GOALS** \*Visualization - design drugs for depicted protein structure

\*Analysis - design drugs based on clustering data

\*Comparison - visualize differing structures to deduce function, or
look at similarities

\*Prediction - predict binding sites or motiffs that can be targetted;
leads to experimentation to see effective drug interaction

\*Design - Observed a function of a protein and design a new version to
perform a specific function

**Fundamentals of protein structure** Basics of AA structure *Primary:
amino acid residue/sequence *Secondary: alpha helices or beta sheets
*Tertiary: Polypeptide chain of AA structures *Quaternary: Assembled
subunits

Amino Acid Nomenclature: \*Amino group, alpha carbon, carbon backbone,
carboxyl group, and R group side chain

Peptide conformation: \*Based on Phi and Psi backbone torsion; angle of
peptide bonds

Major Secondary Structure types: \*Alpha-helix: 3.6 residues per turn in
helix

\*Beta Sheets: antiparallel of beta strands held together by h-bonding
between NH and CO group

**Protein Data Bank PDB practice** *1iep for ABL kinase in leukemia *PDB
file format: element, AA, chain, sequence/residue number ,xyz-coordinate
