Need to check if the data files line up in countData and metaData. Focus
on the id values of the colData metadata file. Use of the “all()”
function allows all entry checking in a vector to see if they’re TRUE

``` r
colnames(countData)
```

colnames(colData)
```

    ## [1] "condition"

``` r
#How to check for all entries? Check colnames of countData and rownames of colData
all(colnames(countData) == rownames(colData))
```

    ## [1] TRUE

``` r
#results all returning TRUE = good
```

``` r
#test for the check
all(c(T,F,T))
```

    ## [1] FALSE

countData needs to be filtered out for the zero entries in all the
experiments.

``` r
#rowSums(countData) >0, loads only data greater than 0. !=0 denotes the values that are not 0 thus TRUE or FALSE
countData = countData [rowSums(countData)>0,]
head(countData)
